# UberUpgrades Revamp
This is a public modification of Uberupgrades. I mainly feel this is needed due to the abandonment of the owner.
The repo already has all of the plugins and requirements, so it's really just a drag and drop moment.

^ all of this is windows, so it kinda is a fortnite moment for those who aren't running windows.
