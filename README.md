# Fixed Uber Upgrades
This is a public modification of Uberupgrades. I mainly feel this is needed due to the abandonment of the owner.
The repo already has all of the plugins and requirements, so it's really just a drag and drop moment.

If you want to run it, add "sm plugins reload tf2attributes_ubup" to server.cfg so your uberupgrades will actually load every time your server restarts or map changes.
